                 selection, population size and the colonization of new
                 environments. The demographic histories of island populations
                 can be reconstructed from patterns of genetic diversity. House
                 mice (Mus musculus) inhabit islands throughout the globe,
                 making them an attractive system for studying island
                 colonization from a genetic perspective. Gough Island, in the
                 central South Atlantic Ocean, is one of the remotest islands
                 in the world. House mice were introduced to Gough Island by
                 sealers during the 19th century and display unusual
                 phenotypes, including exceptionally large body size and
                 carnivorous feeding behaviour. We describe genetic variation
                 in Gough Island mice using mitochondrial sequences, nuclear
                 sequences and microsatellites. Phylogenetic analysis of
                 mitochondrial sequences suggested that Gough Island mice
                 belong to Mus musculus domesticus, with the maternal lineage
                 possibly originating in England or France. Cluster analyses of
                 microsatellites revealed genetic membership for Gough Island
                 mice in multiple coastal populations in Western Europe,
                 suggesting admixed ancestry. Gough Island mice showed
                 substantial reductions in mitochondrial and nuclear sequence
                 variation and weak reductions in microsatellite diversity
                 compared with Western European populations, consistent with a
                 population bottleneck. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)
                 estimated that mice recently colonized Gough Island (~100
                 years ago) and experienced a 98\% reduction in population size
                 followed by a rapid expansion. Our results indicate that the

                 genes, even when those genes have no direct effect on fitness.
                 This article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking,
                 concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and
                 Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is
                 due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with
                 the apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in
                 fitness due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating
                 selection is analysed which bridges these alternative
                 treatments. When alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at
                 a rate lambda, the rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 +
                 E[1/pq]lambda/(2(2lambda + r))), where the recombination rate
                 r is much smaller than the strength of selection. In spatially
                 structured populations, the effects of any one substitution
                 are weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency
                 of a neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the
                 rate of recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more
                 weakly, on the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4(pi rho sigma)2.
                 Spatial subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur
                 more frequently than is indicated by the overall rate of
                 molecular evolution. However, it seems unlikely that such
                 sweeps can be sufficiently frequent to increase significantly

               basis?equivalent in birth and death rates, in rates of
               dispersal, and even in the probability of speciating. Although
               only a first approximation, the symmetry assumption allows the
               development of a quantitative neutral theory of relative species
               abundance and dynamic null hypotheses for the assembly of
               communities in ecological time and for phylogeny and
               phylogeography in evolutionary time. Although Steve Gould was
               not a neutralist, he made use of ideas of symmetry and of null
               models in his science, both of which are fundamental to neutral
               theory in ecology. Here I give a brief overview of the current
               status of neural theory in ecology and phylogeny and, where
               relevant, connect these newer ideas to Gould's work. In

               particularly peripheral isolate speciation, and their
               implications for relative species abundance and species life

               models of phylogeny, but the modern theory suggests that at
               least some of the conclusions from these early neutral models

               identities (e.g., Blackburn and Gaston, 2002; Wiens and
               Donoghue, 2004). This was largely based on the fact that
               biogeography is considered as the science of documenting and
               understanding spatial patterns of biodiversity, which tends to
               have an historical focus, while macroecology, in studying
               relationships between/among organisms and their environment, is
               generally considered to address contemporary questions
               (McIntosh, 1986; Blackburn and Gaston, 2002; Lomolino et al.,

               disciplines can, and do, converge, particularly at intermediate
               spatial and temporal scales (e.g. Ricklefs, 2007; Cavender-Bares
               et al., 2009; Jenkins and Ricklefs, 2011a, 2011b).With this

               changes in environmental conditions (e.g., climate, plate
               tectonics), and the phylogenetic history of organisms, are two
               traditional components of biogeographic study, but these both

               distribution and abundance, i.e., macroecology (Jablonski, 2008;

                 genetic variation is greatly reduced at the site of strong
                 directional selection and increases as the recombinational
                 distance from the site of selection increases. This
                 characteristic pattern can be used to detect recent
                 directional selection on the basis of DNA polymorphism data.
                 However, the large variance of nucleotide diversity in samples
                 of moderate size imposes difficulties in detecting such
                 patterns. We investigated the patterns of genetic variation
                 along a recombining chromosome by constructing ancestral
                 recombination graphs that are modified to incorporate the
                 effect of genetic hitchhiking. A statistical method is
                 proposed to test the significance of a local reduction of
                 variation and a skew of the frequency spectrum caused by a

                 curve or hyperbolic shape on a histogram with many rare
                 species and just a few common species. Here, we review
                 theoretical, empirical and statistical developments in the
                 study of SADs. Several key points emerge. (i) Literally dozens
                 of models have been proposed to explain the hollow curve.
                 Unfortunately, very few models are ever rejected, primarily
                 because few theories make any predictions beyond the
                 hollow-curve SAD itself. (ii) Interesting work has been
                 performed both empirically and theoretically, which goes
                 beyond the hollow-curve prediction to provide a rich variety
                 of information about how SADs behave. These include the study
                 of SADs along environmental gradients and theories that
                 integrate SADs with other biodiversity patterns. Central to
                 this body of work is an effort to move beyond treating the SAD
                 in isolation and to integrate the SAD into its ecological
                 context to enable making many predictions. (iii) Moving
                 forward will entail understanding how sampling and scale
                 affect SADs and developing statistical tools for describing
                 and comparing SADs. We are optimistic that SADs can provide

  abstract = "Comparative phylogeographic studies often reveal disparate levels
              of sequence divergence between lineages spanning a common
              geographic barrier, leading to the conclusion that isolation was
              nonsynchronous. However, only rarely do researchers account for
              the expected variance associated with ancestral coalescence and
              among-taxon variation in demographic history. We introduce a
              flexible approximate Bayesian computational (ABC) framework that
              can test for simultaneous divergence (TSD) using a hierarchical
              model that incorporates idiosyncratic differences in demographic
              history across taxon pairs. The method is tested across a range
              of conditions and is shown to be accurate even with single-locus
              mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data. We apply this method to a
              landmark dataset of putative simultaneous vicariance, eight
              geminate echinoid taxon pairs thought to have been split by the
              Isthmus of Panama 3.1 million years ago. The ABC posterior
              estimates are not consistent with a history of simultaneous
              vicariance given these data. Subsequent ABC estimates under a
              constrained model that assumes two divergence times across the
              eight taxon pairs suggests simultaneous divergence 3.1 million
              years ago in seven of the taxon pairs and a more recent
              divergence in the remaining taxon pair. These ABC estimates on
              the simultaneous divergence of the seven taxon pairs correspond
              to a DNA substitution rate of approximately 1.59\% per lineage
              per million years at the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase I gene. This
              ABC framework can easily be modified to analyze single taxon-pair
              datasets and/or be expanded to include multiple loci, migration,
              recombination, and other idiosyncratic demographic histories. The
              flexible aspect of ABC and its built-in evaluation of estimator
              bias and statistical power has the potential to greatly enhance
              statistical rigor in phylogeographic studies.",

                 accounting for ancestral polymorphism and gene tree-species
                 tree conflict. A number of methods have been developed in the
                 past few years to estimate the species tree under the MSC. The
                 full likelihood methods (including maximum likelihood and
                 Bayesian inference) average over the unknown gene trees and
                 accommodate their uncertainties properly but involve intensive
                 computation. The approximate or summary coalescent methods are
                 computationally fast and are applicable to genomic datasets
                 with thousands of loci, but do not make an efficient use of
                 information in the multilocus data. Most of them take the
                 two-step approach of reconstructing the gene trees for
                 multiple loci by phylogenetic methods and then treating the

                 the statistical nature of the species tree estimation problem
                 under the MSC, and explore the conceptual issues and
                 challenges of species tree estimation by focusing mainly on
                 simple cases of three or four closely related species. We use
                 mathematical analysis and computer simulation to demonstrate
                 that large differences in statistical performance may exist
                 between the two classes of methods. We illustrate that several
                 counterintuitive behaviors may occur with the summary methods
                 but they are due to inefficient use of information in the data
                 by summary methods and vanish when the data are analyzed using
                 full-likelihood methods. These include (i) unidentifiability

                 of more data. We discuss the challenges and strategies of
                 species tree inference for distantly related species when the
                 molecular clock is violated, and highlight the need for

               radiations in the context of diversity-dependent
               diversification. Diversity dependence causes diversification to
               decelerate at the end of an adaptive radiation but also plays a
               key role in the initial pulse of diversification. In particular,
               key innovations (which in our definition include novel traits as
               well as new environments) may cause decoupling of the
               diversity-dependent dynamics of the innovative clade from the
               diversity-dependent dynamics of its ancestral clade. We present
               a likelihood-based inference method to test for decoupling of
               diversity dependence using molecular phylogenies. The method,
               which can handle incomplete phylogenies, identifies when the
               decoupling took place and which diversification parameters are
               affected. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the
               molecular phylogeny of the North American clade of the legume
               tribe Psoraleeae (47 extant species, of which 4 are missing).
               Two diversification rate shifts were previously identified for
               this clade; our analysis shows that the first, positive shift
               can be associated with decoupling of two Pediomelum subgenera
               from the other Psoraleeae lineages, while we argue that the
               second, negative shift can be attributed to speciation being
               protracted. The latter explanation yields nonzero extinction
               rates, in contrast to previous findings. Our framework offers a
               new perspective on macroevolution: new environments and novel

               either increased or reduced gene flow between populations.

               panmixia and reconstruct a history characterized by population
               size changes. This is potentially problematic as population
               structure can generate spurious signals of population size
               change through time. Moreover, when the model assumed for
               demographic inference is misspecified, genomic data will likely
               increase the precision of misleading if not meaningless
               parameters. For instance, if data were generated under an
               n-island model (characterized by the number of islands and
               migrants exchanged) inference based on a model of population
               size change would produce precise estimates of a bottleneck that
               would be meaningless. In addition, archaeological or climatic
               events around the bottleneck’s timing might provide a reasonable
               but potentially misleading scenario. In a context of model
               uncertainty (panmixia versus structure) genomic data may thus
               not necessarily lead to improved statistical inference. We
               consider two haploid genomes and develop a theory that explains
               why any demographic model with structure will necessarily be
               interpreted as a series of changes in population size by
               inference methods ignoring structure. We formalize a parameter,
               the inverse instantaneous coalescence rate, and show that it is
               equivalent to a population size only in panmictic models, and is
               mostly misleading for structured models. We argue that this
               issue affects all population genetics methods ignoring
               population structure which may thus infer population size
               changes that never took place. We apply our approach to human

  abstract    = "A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand how
                 natural selection has shaped patterns of genetic variation
                 across genomes. Studies in a variety of species have shown
                 that neutral genetic diversity (intra-species differences) has
                 been reduced at sites linked to those under direct selection.
                 However, the effect of linked selection on neutral sequence
                 divergence (inter-species differences) remains ambiguous.
                 While empirical studies have reported correlations between
                 divergence and recombination, which is interpreted as evidence
                 for natural selection reducing linked neutral divergence,
                 theory argues otherwise, especially for species that have
                 diverged long ago. Here we address these outstanding issues by
                 examining whether natural selection can affect divergence
                 between both closely and distantly related species. We show
                 that neutral divergence between closely related species (e.g.
                 human-primate) is negatively correlated with functional
                 content and positively correlated with human recombination
                 rate. We also find that neutral divergence between distantly
                 related species (e.g. human-rodent) is negatively correlated
                 with functional content and positively correlated with
                 estimates of background selection from primates. These
                 patterns persist after accounting for the confounding factors
                 of hypermutable CpG sites, GC content, and biased gene
                 conversion. Coalescent models indicate that even when the
                 contribution of ancestral polymorphism to divergence is small,
                 background selection in the ancestral population can still
                 explain a large proportion of the variance in divergence
                 across the genome, generating the observed correlations. Our
                 findings reveal that, contrary to previous intuition, natural
                 selection can indirectly affect linked neutral divergence
                 between both closely and distantly related species. Though we
                 cannot formally exclude the possibility that the direct
                 effects of purifying selection drive some of these patterns,
                 such a scenario would be possible only if more of the genome
                 is under purifying selection than currently believed. Our work
                 has implications for understanding the evolution of genomes
                 and interpreting patterns of genetic variation.",

  abstract    = "Inferring the ancestral dynamics of effective population size
                 is a long-standing question in population genetics, which can
                 now be tackled much more accurately thanks to the massive
                 genomic data available in many species. Several promising
                 methods that take advantage of whole-genome sequences have
                 been recently developed in this context. However, they can
                 only be applied to rather small samples, which limits their
                 ability to estimate recent population size history. Besides,
                 they can be very sensitive to sequencing or phasing errors.
                 Here we introduce a new approximate Bayesian computation
                 approach named PopSizeABC that allows estimating the evolution
                 of the effective population size through time, using a large
                 sample of complete genomes. This sample is summarized using
                 the folded allele frequency spectrum and the average zygotic
                 linkage disequilibrium at different bins of physical distance,
                 two classes of statistics that are widely used in population
                 genetics and can be easily computed from unphased and
                 unpolarized SNP data. Our approach provides accurate
                 estimations of past population sizes, from the very first
                 generations before present back to the expected time to the
                 most recent common ancestor of the sample, as shown by
                 simulations under a wide range of demographic scenarios. When
                 applied to samples of 15 or 25 complete genomes in four cattle
                 breeds (Angus, Fleckvieh, Holstein and Jersey), PopSizeABC
                 revealed a series of population declines, related to
                 historical events such as domestication or modern breed
                 creation. We further highlight that our approach is robust to
                 sequencing errors, provided summary statistics are computed

  abstract    = "The metaphor of 'genomic islands of speciation' was first used
                 to describe heterogeneous differentiation among loci between
                 the genomes of closely related species. The biological model
                 proposed to explain these differences was that the regions
                 showing high levels of differentiation were resistant to gene
                 flow between species, while the remainder of the genome was
                 being homogenized by gene flow and consequently showed lower
                 levels of differentiation. However, the conditions under which
                 such differentiation can occur at multiple unlinked loci are
                 restrictive; additionally, essentially, all previous analyses
                 have been carried out using relative measures of divergence,
                 which can be misleading when regions with different levels of
                 recombination are compared. Here, we test the model of
                 differential gene flow by asking whether absolute divergence
                 is also higher in the previously identified 'islands'. Using
                 five species pairs for which full sequence data are available,
                 we find that absolute measures of divergence are not higher in
                 genomic islands. Instead, in all cases examined, we find
                 reduced diversity in these regions, a consequence of which is
                 that relative measures of divergence are abnormally high.
                 These data therefore do not support a model of differential
                 gene flow among loci, although islands of relative divergence
                 may represent loci involved in local adaptation. Simulations
                 using the program IMa2 further suggest that inferences of any

                 manner to environmental events are expected to share patterns
                 of evolutionary diversification. However, the identification
                 of such groups has largely been based on qualitative, post hoc
                 analyses. We develop here two methods (posterior predictive
                 simulation [PPS], Kuhner-Felsenstein [K-F] analysis of
                 variance [ANOVA]) for the analysis of codistributed species
                 that, given a group of species with a shared pattern of
                 diversification, allow empiricists to identify those taxa that
                 do not codiversify (i.e., ``outlier'' species). The
                 identification of outlier species makes it possible to jointly
                 estimate the evolutionary history of co-diversifying taxa. To
                 evaluate the approaches presented here, we collected data from
                 P{\'a}ramo dipterans, identified outlier species, and
                 estimated a ``community tree'' from species that are
                 identified as having codiversified. Our results demonstrate
                 that dipteran communities from different P{\'a}ramo habitats
                 in the same mountain range are more closely related than
                 communities in other ranges. We also conduct simulation
                 testing to evaluate this approach. Results suggest that our
                 approach provides a useful addition to comparative
                 phylogeographic methods, while identifying aspects of the
                 analysis that require careful interpretation. In particular,
                 both the PPS and K-F ANOVA perform acceptably when there are
                 one or two outlier species, but less so as the number of
                 outliers increases. This is likely a function of the
                 corresponding degradation of the signal of community
                 divergence; without a strong signal from a codiversifying
                 community, there is no dominant pattern from which to detect
                 an outlier species. For this reason, both the magnitude of K-F
                 distance distribution and outside knowledge about the
                 phylogeographic history of each putative member of the

                 characterised by a pattern of isolation by distance (IBD): due
                 to limited dispersal, individuals that are geographically
                 close tend to be genetically more similar than individuals
                 that are far apart. Despite the ubiquity of IBD in nature,
                 many commonly used statistical tests are based on a null model
                 that is completely non-spatial, the Island model. Here, I
                 argue that patterns of spatial autocorrelation deriving from
                 IBD present a problem for such tests as it can severely bias
                 their outcome. I use simulated data to illustrate this problem
                 for two widely used types of tests: tests of hierarchical
                 population structure and the detection of loci under
                 selection. My results show that for both types of tests the
                 presence of IBD can indeed lead to a large number of false
                 positives. I therefore argue that all analyses in a study
                 should take the spatial dependence in the data into account,
                 unless it can be shown that there is no spatial
                 autocorrelation in the allele frequency distribution that is
                 under investigation. Thus, it is urgent to develop additional

                 Information about the phenotype under selection is not

                 reflect the forces acting on biodiversity. A growing number of
                 studies have found that genetic (within-species) and species
                 diversity can be correlated in space (the so-called
                 species-gene diversity correlation [SGDC]), which suggests
                 that they are controlled by nonindependent processes. Positive
                 SGDCs are generally assumed to arise from parallel responses
                 of genetic and species diversity to variation in site size and
                 connectivity. However, this argument implicitly assumes a
                 neutral model that has yet to be developed. Here, we build
                 such a model to predict SGDC in a metacommunity. We describe
                 how SGDC emerges from competition within sites and variation
                 in connectivity and carrying capacity among sites. We then
                 introduce the formerly ignored mutation process, which affects
                 genetic but not species diversity. When mutation rate is low,
                 our model confirms that variation in the number of migrants
                 among sites creates positive SGDCs. However, when considering
                 high mutation rates, interactions between mutation, migration,
                 and competition can produce negative SGDCs. Neutral processes
                 thus do not always contribute positively to SGDCs. Our
                 approach provides empirical guidelines for interpreting these

                 rainforest contraction had on speciation has been
                 controversial because of inconsistent palaeoecological and
                 genetic data. Despite the strong interest in examining the
                 role of climatic change on speciation in the Neotropics there
                 has been few comparative studies, particularly, those that
                 include non-rainforest taxa. We used bird species that inhabit
                 humid or dry habitats that dispersed across the Panamanian
                 Isthmus to characterize temporal and spatial patterns of
                 speciation across this barrier. Here, we show that these two
                 assemblages of birds exhibit temporally different speciation
                 time patterns that supports multiple cycles of speciation.
                 Evidence for these cycles is further corroborated by the
                 finding that both assemblages consist of 'young' and 'old'

                 geographically more distant than pairs of humid habitat

                 it is often unclear whether divergence is due simply to
                 separation or whether populations have also experienced gene
                 flow. These questions can be addressed with a full model of
                 population separation with gene flow, by applying a Markov

               climate change is a central goal of comparative phylogeography
               and comparative population genomics, and an endeavor that has
               increasing potential to integrate with community ecology. New
               sequencing technology now provides the potential to gain complex
               demographic inference at unprecedented resolution across
               assemblages of non-model species. To this end, we introduce the
               aggregate site frequency spectrum (aSFS), an expansion of the
               site frequency spectrum to use single nucleotide polymorphism
               (SNP) datasets collected from multiple, co-distributed species
               for assemblage-level demographic inference. We describe how the
               aSFS is constructed over an arbitrary number of independent
               population samples and then demonstrate how the aSFS can
               differentiate various multi-species demographic histories under
               a wide range of sampling configurations while allowing effective
               population sizes and expansion magnitudes to vary independently.
               We subsequently couple the aSFS with a hierarchical approximate
               Bayesian computation (hABC) framework to estimate degree of
               temporal synchronicity in expansion times across taxa, including
               an empirical demonstration with a dataset consisting of five
               populations of the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus
               aculeatus). Corroborating what is generally understood about the
               recent post-glacial origins of these populations, the joint
               aSFS/hABC analysis strongly suggests that the stickleback data
               are most consistent with synchronous expansion after the Last
               Glacial Maximum (posterior probability = 0.99). The aSFS will
               have general application for multi-level statistical frameworks
               to test models involving assemblages and/or communities and as
               large-scale SNP data from non-model species become routine, the
               aSFS expands the potential for powerful next-generation

               initially linked to it increase in frequency; on average, this
               reduces diversity in the surrounding region of the genome. In
               the first analysis of this effect, Maynard-Smith and Haigh
               (1974) followed the increase of the neutral allele that chanced
               to be associated with the new mutation in the first generation,
               and assumed that the subsequent increase was deterministic.
               Later analyses, based on either coalescence arguments, or on
               diffusion equations for the mean and variance of allele
               frequency, have also made one or both of these assumptions. In
               the early generations, stochastic fluctuations in the frequency
               of the selected allele, and coalescence of neutral lineages, can
               be accounted for correctly by following relationships between
               genes conditional on the number of copies of the favourable
               allele. This analysis shows that the hitch-hiking effect is
               increased because an allele that is destined to fix tends to
               increase more rapidly than exponentially. However, the identity
               generated by the selective sweep has the same form as in
               previous work, h[r/s] (2 Ns)−2r/s, where h[r/s] tends to 1 with
               tight linkage. This analysis is extended to samples of many
               genes; then, genes may trace back to several families of
               lineages, each related through a common ancestor early in the
               selective sweep. Simulations show that the number and sizes of

                 different relationships between species diversity and genetic
                 diversity might arise and therefore when one level of
                 diversity may be predicted using the other. I used simulation
                 models to investigate the parallel influence of locality area,
                 immigration rate, and environmental heterogeneity on species
                 diversity and genetic diversity. The most common pattern was
                 moderate to strong positive species-genetic diversity
                 correlations (SGDCs). Such correlations may be driven by any
                 one of the three locality characteristics examined, but
                 important exceptions and patterns emerged. Genetic diversity
                 and species diversity were more weakly correlated when genetic
                 diversity was measured for rare versus common species.
                 Environmental heterogeneity not only imposes spatially varying
                 selection on populations and communities but also causes
                 changes in species' population sizes and therefore genetic
                 diversity; these interacting processes can create positive,
                 negative, or unimodal relationships of genetic diversity with
                 species diversity. When species are considered as part of
                 multispecies communities, predictions from single-species
                 models of genetic diversity apply in some instances (effects

  abstract    = "In contrast with the classical population genetics theory that
                 models population structure as discrete panmictic units
                 connected by migration, many populations exhibit heterogeneous
                 spatial gradients in population connectivity across
                 semi-continuous habitats. The historical dynamics of such
                 spatially structured populations can be captured by a
                 spatially explicit coalescent model recently proposed by
                 Etheridge (2008) and Barton et al. (2010a, 2010b) and whereby
                 allelic lineages are distributed in a two-dimensional spatial
                 continuum and move within this continuum based on extinction
                 and coalescent events. Though theoretically rigorous, this
                 model, which we here refer to as the continuum model, has not
                 yet been implemented for demographic inference. To this end,
                 here we introduce and demonstrate a statistical pipeline that
                 couples the coalescent simulator of Kelleher et al. (2014)
                 that simulates genealogies under the continuum model, with an
                 approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework for parameter
                 estimation of neighborhood size (that is, the number of
                 locally breeding individuals) and dispersal ability (that is,
                 the distance an offspring can travel within a generation).
                 Using empirically informed simulations and simulation-based
                 ABC cross-validation, we first show that neighborhood size can
                 be accurately estimated. We then apply our pipeline to the
                 South African endemic shrub species Berkheya cuneata to use
                 the resulting estimates of dispersal ability and neighborhood
                 size to infer the average population density of the species.
                 More generally, we show that spatially explicit coalescent
                 models can be successfully integrated into model-based
                 demographic inference.",

                 'isolation by distance'-a phenomenon where genetic similarity
                 decays with geographic distance. In a heterogeneous habitat,
                 this may occur more quickly in some regions than in others:
                 for example, barriers to gene flow can accelerate
                 differentiation between neighboring groups. We use the concept
                 of 'effective migration' to model the relationship between
                 genetics and geography. In this paradigm, effective migration
                 is low in regions where genetic similarity decays quickly. We

                 diversity of species with important functional, economic and
                 aesthetic value. Ecologists have long questioned how this
                 diversity is maintained. Classic theory shows that stable
                 coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches;
                 this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological
                 differences presumed to maintain diversity. That niche
                 differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been
                 challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which
                 explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors. The
                 ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better
                 understanding of the collective importance of niche
                 differences for the diversity observed in ecological
                 communities. Here we integrate theory and experimentation to
                 show that niche differences collectively stabilize the
                 dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual
                 plants. We used field-parameterized population models to
                 develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the
                 stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population
                 growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several
                 orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for
                 rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations
                 of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over
                 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche
                 differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by
                 the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating
                 species' relative abundances, population growth rates
                 increased when species became rare--the demographic signature
                 of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence
                 that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing

  abstract  = "Stochastic niche theory resolves many of the differences between
               neutral theory and classical tradeoff-based niche theories of
               resource competition and community structure. In stochastic
               niche theory, invading species become established only if
               propagules can survive stochastic mortality while growing to
               maturity on the resources left unconsumed by established
               species. The theory makes three predictions about community
               structure. First, stochastic niche assembly creates communities
               in which species dominate approximately equally wide ``slices''
               of the habitat's spatial heterogeneity. These niche widths
               generate realistic distributions of species relative abundances
               for which, contrary to neutral theory but consistent with
               numerous observations, there are strong correlations among
               species traits, species abundances, and environmental
               conditions. Second, slight decreases in resource levels are
               predicted to cause large decreases in the probability that a
               propagule would survive to be an adult. These decreases cause
               local diversity to be limited by the inhibitory effects of
               resource use by established species on the establishment
               (recruitment) of potential invaders. If resource pulses or
               disturbance allowed invaders to overcome this recruitment
               limitation, many more species could indefinitely coexist. Third,
               the low invasibility of high diversity communities is predicted
               to result not from diversity per se, but from the uniformly low
               levels of resources that occur in high-diversity communities
               created by stochastic competitive assembly. This prediction
               provides a potential solution to the invasion paradox, which is
               the tendency for highly diverse regions to be more heavily
               invaded.",

  abstract    = "In 2004, the term 'ghost population' was introduced to
                 summarize the effect of unsampled subpopulations that exchange
                 migrants with other subpopulations that have been sampled.
                 Estimated long-term migration rates among populations sampled
                 will be affected by ghost populations. Although it would be
                 convenient to be able to define an apparent migration matrix
                 among sampled populations that incorporate the exchange of
                 migrants with ghost populations, no such matrix can be defined
                 in a way that predicts all features of the coalescent process
                 for the true migration matrix. This paper shows that if the
                 underlying migration matrix is symmetric, it is possible to
                 define an apparent migration matrix among sampled
                 subpopulations that predicts the same within-population and
                 between-population homozygosities among sampled populations as
                 is predicted by the true migration matrix. Application of this
                 method shows that there is no simple relationship between true
                 and apparent migration rates, nor is there a way to place an
                 upper bound on the effect of ghost populations. In general,
                 ghost populations can create the appearance of migration
                 between subpopulations that do not actually exchange migrants.
                 Comparison with published results from the application of the
                 program, MIGRATE, shows that the apparent migration rates
                 inferred with that program in a three-subpopulation model
                 differ from those based on pairwise homozygosities. The
                 apparent migration matrix determined by the method described
                 in this paper probably represents the upper bound on the
                 effect of ghost populations.",

                 understood when multiple selected variants segregate in nearby
                 regions of the genome. Classical population genetics fails to
                 account for interference between linked mutations, which grows
                 increasingly severe as the density of selected polymorphisms
                 increases. Here, we describe a simple limit that emerges when
                 interference is common, in which the fitness effects of
                 individual mutations play a relatively minor role. Instead,
                 similar to models of quantitative genetics, molecular
                 evolution is determined by the variance in fitness within the
                 population, defined over an effectively asexual segment of the
                 genome (a ``linkage block''). We exploit this insensitivity in
                 a new ``coarse-grained'' coalescent framework, which
                 approximates the effects of many weakly selected mutations
                 with a smaller number of strongly selected mutations that
                 create the same variance in fitness. This approximation
                 generates accurate and efficient predictions for silent site
                 variability when interference is common. However, these
                 results suggest that there is reduced power to resolve
                 individual selection pressures when interference is

               genetic diversity has been proposed, consistent with neutral
               predictions in macroecology. We assessed the species--genetic
               diversity correlation in tenebrionid beetle communities of the
               Aegean archipelago on 15 islands of different sizes, distances
               to mainland, and ages of isolation. Alpha and beta diversity of
               species and haplotypes were assessed using sequences of >1,000
               individuals (mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 and nuclear
               muscular protein 20). We show that (i) there is a strong
               species-area and haplotype-area relationship; (ii) species
               richness in island communities is correlated with intraspecific
               genetic diversity in the constituent species except when island
               size or distance to mainland is factored out in partial
               correlations; (iii) community similarity declines exponentially
               at an increasing rate when calculated on the basis of species,
               nuclear, and mtDNA haplotypes; and (iv) distance decay of
               community similarity is slower in dispersive sand-dwelling
               lineages compared with less dispersive lineages that are not
               sand obligate. Taken together, these correlated patterns at the
               species and haplotype level are consistent with individual-based
               stochastic dispersal proposed by neutral theories of
               biodiversity. The results also demonstrate the utility of
               haplotype data for exploring macroecological patterns in poorly

                 has been considered a potentially important mechanism

                 Colonizing species, such as members of the avian species
                 complex Zosterops lateralis, have been used to support this
                 idea. A large amount of background information on recent
                 colonization history is available for one Zosterops
                 subspecies, Z. lateralis lateralis, providing the opportunity
                 to reconstruct the population dynamics of its colonization
                 sequence. We used a Bayesian approach to combine historical
                 and demographic information available on Z. l. lateralis with
                 genotypic data from six microsatellite loci, and a rejection
                 algorithm to make simultaneous inferences on the demographic
                 parameters describing the recent colonization history of this
                 subspecies in four southwest Pacific islands. Demographic
                 models assuming mutation-drift equilibrium or a large number

                 events for three of four recently colonized island
                 populations. Posterior distributions of demographic parameters
                 supported (i) a large stable effective population size of
                 several thousands individuals with point estimates around
                 4000-5000; (ii) a founder event of very low intensity with a
                 large effective number of founders around 150-200 individuals
                 for each island in three of four islands, suggesting the
                 colonization of those islands by one flock of large size or
                 several flocks of average size; and (iii) a founder event of
                 higher intensity on Norfolk Island with an effective number of
                 founders around 20 individuals, suggesting colonization by a
                 single flock of moderate size. Our inferences on demographic
                 parameters, especially those on the number of founders, were

                 parental populations or reduce the fitness of hybrids-the
                 so-called species barriers. The speciation genomic literature,
                 however, is mainly a collection of case studies, each with its
                 own approach and specificities, such that a global view of the
                 gradual process of evolution from one to two species is
                 currently lacking. Of primary importance is the prevalence of
                 gene flow between diverging entities, which is central in most
                 species concepts and has been widely discussed in recent
                 years. Here, we explore the continuum of speciation thanks to
                 a comparative analysis of genomic data from 61 pairs of
                 populations/species of animals with variable levels of
                 divergence. Gene flow between diverging gene pools is assessed
                 under an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework. We
                 show that the intermediate ``grey zone'' of speciation, in
                 which taxonomy is often controversial, spans from 0.5\% to 2\%
                 of net synonymous divergence, irrespective of species life
                 history traits or ecology. Thanks to appropriate modeling of
                 among-locus variation in genetic drift and introgression rate,
                 we clarify the status of the majority of ambiguous cases and

                 some but not all loci are affected by barriers to gene flow)
                 and highlights the intrinsic difficulty, both statistical and

                 evolution owing to their discrete geographical nature and

                 been a significant advance for evolutionary biologists,
                 providing a tool for answering questions about the diversity

                 relate to both the origin and causes of species diversity both
                 within an archipelago and on individual islands. Within a
                 phylogenetic framework one can answer fundamental questions

                 biodiversity are of central interest in ecology and evolution
                 for several reasons: to identify general patterns in nature
                 (e.g. species-area relationships, latitudinal gradients), to
                 inform conservation priorities (e.g. identifying hotspots,
                 prioritizing management efforts) and to draw inferences about
                 processes, historical or otherwise (e.g. adaptation, the
                 centre of origin of particular clades). There are long
                 traditions in ecology and evolutionary biology of examining
                 spatial patterns of biodiversity among species (i.e. in
                 multispecies communities) and within species, respectively,
                 and there has been a recent surge of interest in studying
                 these two types of pattern simultaneously. The idea is that
                 examining both levels of diversity can materially advance the
                 above-stated goals and perhaps lead to entirely novel lines of
                 inquiry. Here, we review two broad categories of approach to
                 merging studies of inter- and intraspecific variation: (i) the
                 study of phenotypic trait variation along environmental
                 gradients and (ii) the study of relationships between patterns
                 of molecular genetic variation within species and patterns of
                 distribution and diversity across species. For the latter, we
                 report a new meta-analysis in which we find that correlations

                 positive and significantly stronger in studies with discrete
                 sampling units (e.g. islands, lakes, forest fragments) than in
                 studies with nondiscrete sampling units (e.g. equal-area study

                 originating from microbes adapted to the lungs, as opposed to
                 microbes dispersing to the lungs from other body sites and the
                 atmosphere, is not known. We use a neutral model of community
                 ecology to distinguish members of the lung microbiome whose
                 presence is consistent with dispersal from other body sites
                 and those that deviate from the model, suggesting a
                 competitive advantage to these microbes in the lungs. We find
                 that the composition of the healthy lung microbiome is
                 consistent with predictions of the neutral model, reflecting
                 the overriding role of dispersal of microbes from the oral
                 cavity in shaping the microbial community in healthy lungs. In
                 contrast, the microbiome of diseased lungs was readily
                 distinguished as being under active selection. We also
                 assessed the viability of microbes from lung samples by
                 cultivation with a variety of media and incubation conditions.
                 Bacteria recovered by cultivation from healthy lungs
                 represented species that comprised 61\% of the 16S

                 lavage samples. IMPORTANCE: Neutral distribution of microbes
                 is a distinguishing feature of the microbiome in healthy
                 lungs, wherein constant dispersal of bacteria from the oral
                 cavity overrides differential growth of bacteria. No bacterial
                 species consistently deviated from the model predictions in
                 healthy lungs, although representatives of many of the

                 important for understanding the origins of communities and how
                 likely it is that species will disperse and resist extinction.
                 The equilibrium theory of island biogeography (ETIB) and, as a
                 simple model of sampling abundances, the unified neutral
                 theory of biodiversity (UNTB), predict that in situations
                 where mainland to island migration is high, species-abundance
                 relationships explain the presence of taxa on islands. Thus,
                 more abundant mainland species should have a higher
                 probability of occurring on adjacent islands. In contrast to
                 UNTB, if certain groups have traits that permit them to
                 disperse to islands better than other taxa, then phylogeny may
                 be more predictive of which taxa will occur on islands. Taking
                 surveys of 54 island snake communities in the Eastern Nearctic
                 along with mainland communities that have abundance data for
                 each species, we use phylogenetic assembly methods and UNTB
                 estimates to predict island communities. Species richness is
                 predicted by island area, whereas turnover from the mainland
                 to island communities is random with respect to phylogeny.
                 Community structure appears to be ecologically neutral and
                 abundance on the mainland is the best predictor of presence on
                 islands. With regard to young and proximate islands, where
                 allopatric or cladogenetic speciation is not a factor, we find
                 that simple neutral models following UNTB and ETIB predict the

               phylogenies. Recent genomic analyses are showing this in many
               insects and vertebrates, as well as in microbes and plants. In
               microbes, lateral gene transfer is the dominant process that

               adaptive radiations, some sexual compatibility may exist among
               them. Introgression and reticulation can thereby affect all

                 test important ecological theories for arguably the most
                 important ecosystem to human health-the human microbiome.
                 Existing limited number of studies have reported conflicting
                 evidence in the case of the neutral theory; the present study
                 aims to comprehensively test the neutral theory with extensive
                 HMP datasets covering all five major body sites inhabited by
                 the human microbiome. Utilizing 7437 datasets of bacterial
                 community samples, we discovered that only 49 communities
                 (less than 1\%) satisfied the neutral theory, and concluded
                 that human microbial communities are not neutral in general.
                 The 49 positive cases, although only a tiny minority, do
                 demonstrate the existence of neutral processes. We realize
                 that the traditional doctrine of microbial biogeography
                 ``Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects''
                 first proposed by Baas-Becking resolves the apparent
                 contradiction. The first part of Baas-Becking doctrine states
                 that microbes are not dispersal-limited and therefore are
                 neutral prone, and the second part reiterates that the freely
                 dispersed microbes must endure selection by the environment.
                 Therefore, in most cases, it is the host environment that

                 application of these methods to evolutionary history more

                 providing insights into the historical/biogeographic processes
                 driving population genetic structure and divergence. Here we
                 discuss how this emphasis, and the corresponding lack of
                 methods for extracting information about biotic/intrinsic
                 contributions to patterns of genetic variation, may bias our
                 general understanding of the factors driving genetic
                 structure. Specifically, this emphasis has promoted a tendency
                 to attribute discordant phylogeographic patterns to the
                 idiosyncracies of history, as well as an adherence to generic
                 null expectations of concordance with reduced predictive
                 power. We advocate that it is time for a paradigm shift in
                 comparative phylogeography, especially given the limited
                 utility of the concordance criterion as genomic data provide
                 ever-increasing levels of resolution. Instead of adhering to
                 the concordance-discordance dichotomy, comparative
                 phylogeography needs to emphasize the contribution of
                 taxon-specific traits that will determine whether concordance
                 is a meaningful criterion for evaluating hypotheses or may
                 predict discordant phylogeographic structure. Through
                 reference to some case studies we illustrate how refined
                 hypotheses based on taxon-specific traits can provide improved
                 predictive frameworks to forecast species responses to
                 climatic change or biogeographic barriers while gaining unique
                 insights about the taxa themselves and their interactions with

              biodiversity, and given biodiversity's centrality to quality of
              life, it is imperative that current ecological knowledge fully
              informs societal decision making. Over the past two decades,
              ecological science has undergone many significant shifts in
              emphasis and perspective, which have important implications for
              how we manage ecosystems and species. In particular, a shift has
              occurred from the equilibrium paradigm to one that recognizes the
              dynamic, non-equilibrium nature of ecosystems. Revised thinking
              about the spatial and temporal dynamics of ecological systems has
              important implications for management. Thus, it is of growing
              concern to ecologists and others that these recent developments
              have not been translated into information useful to managers and
              policy makers. Many conservation policies and plans are still
              based on equilibrium assumptions. A fundamental difficulty with
              integrating current ecological thinking into biodiversity policy
              and management planning is that field observations have yet to
              provide compelling evidence for many of the relationships
              suggested by non-equilibrium ecology. Yet despite this scientific
              uncertainty, management and policy decisions must still be made.
              This paper was motivated by the need for considered scientific
              debate on the significance of current ideas in theoretical
              ecology for biodiversity conservation. This paper aims to provide
              a platform for such discussion by presenting a critical synthesis
              of recent ecological literature that (1) identifies core issues
              in ecological theory, and (2) explores the implications of

                 independent, population genetic-derived estimates of
                 among-community dispersal. We sampled floodplain and terra
                 firme communities of the diverse tree genus Inga (Fabaceae)
                 across a 250-km transect in Amazonian Peru and found patterns
                 of distance-decay in compositional similarity in both habitat
                 types. However, conventional analyses of distance-decay masked
                 a zone of increased species turnover present in the middle of
                 the transect. We estimated past seed dispersal among the same
                 communities by examining geographic plastid DNA variation for
                 eight widespread Inga species and uncovered a population
                 genetic break in the majority of species that is
                 geographically coincident with the zone of increased species
                 turnover. Analyses of these and 12 additional Inga species
                 shared between two communities located on opposite sides of
                 the zone showed that the populations experienced divergence

                 community dynamics of extinct organisms is not possible. As an
                 alternative, neutral ecological models suggest that species
                 abundance distributions reflect dynamical processes like
                 migration, competition, recruitment, and extinction. Live-dead

  abstract    = "The availability of large-scale population genomic sequence
                 data has resulted in an explosion in efforts to infer the
                 demographic histories of natural populations across a broad
                 range of organisms. As demographic events alter coalescent
                 genealogies, they leave detectable signatures in patterns of
                 genetic variation within and between populations. Accordingly,
                 a variety of approaches have been designed to leverage
                 population genetic data to uncover the footprints of
                 demographic change in the genome. The vast majority of these
                 methods make the simplifying assumption that the measures of
                 genetic variation used as their input are unaffected by
                 natural selection. However, natural selection can dramatically
                 skew patterns of variation not only at selected sites, but at
                 linked, neutral loci as well. Here we assess the impact of
                 recent positive selection on demographic inference by
                 characterizing the performance of three popular methods
                 through extensive simulation of data sets with varying numbers
                 of linked selective sweeps. In particular, we examined three
                 different demographic models relevant to a number of species,
                 finding that positive selection can bias parameter estimates
                 of each of these models-often severely. We find that selection
                 can lead to incorrect inferences of population size changes
                 when none have occurred. Moreover, we show that linked
                 selection can lead to incorrect demographic model selection,
                 when multiple demographic scenarios are compared. We argue
                 that natural populations may experience the amount of recent
                 positive selection required to skew inferences. These results
                 suggest that demographic studies conducted in many species to
                 date may have exaggerated the extent and frequency of
                 population size changes.",

                 predict both the niche differences that stabilise coexistence
                 and the average fitness differences that drive competitive
                 dominance. These still largely untested predictions complicate
                 Darwin's hypothesis that more closely related species less
                 easily coexist, and challenge the use of community
                 phylogenetic patterns to infer competition. We field
                 parameterised models of competitor dynamics with pairs of 18
                 California annual plant species, and then related species'
                 niche and fitness differences to their phylogenetic distance.
                 Stabilising niche differences were unrelated to phylogenetic
                 distance, while species' average fitness showed phylogenetic
                 structure. This meant that more distant relatives had greater
                 competitive asymmetry, which should favour the coexistence of
                 close relatives. Nonetheless, coexistence proved unrelated to
                 phylogeny, due in part to increasing variance in fitness
                 differences with phylogenetic distance, a previously
                 overlooked property of such relationships. Together, these

                 collection of individuals is a summary statistic that is
                 commonly used for parametric inference in population genetics.
                 Despite the popularity of SFS-based inference methods, little
                 is currently known about the information theoretic limit on
                 the estimation accuracy as a function of sample size. Here, we
                 show that using the SFS to estimate the size history of a
                 population has a minimax error of at least O(1/log s), where s
                 is the number of independent segregating sites used in the
                 analysis. This rate is exponentially worse than known
                 convergence rates for many classical estimation problems in
                 statistics. Another surprising aspect of our theoretical bound
                 is that it does not depend on the dimension of the SFS, which
                 is related to the number of sampled individuals. This means
                 that, for a fixed number s of segregating sites considered,
                 using more individuals does not help to reduce the minimax
                 error bound. Our result pertains to populations that have
                 experienced a bottleneck, and we argue that it can be expected
