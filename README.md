# Linking evolutionary and ecological theory illuminates non-equilibrium biodiversity 

*A paper linking ecological and population genetic theories of diversity*

Whether or not biodiversity dynamics tend toward stable equilibria remains an unsolved question in ecology and evolution with important implications for our understanding of diversity and its conservation. Phylo/population genetic models and macroecological theory represent two primary lenses through which we view biodiversity. While phylo/population genetics provide an averaged view of changes in demography and diversity over timescales of generations to geological epochs, macroecology provides an ahistorical description of commonness and rarity across contemporary co-occurring species. Our goal is to combine these two approaches to gain novel insights into the non-equilibrium nature of biodiversity. We help guide near future research with a call for bioinformatic advances and an outline of quantitative predictions made possible by our approach.
